# Codewars
This repository contains my solutions to problems (katas) on Codewars.

Filenames consist of the difficulty of the problem + the name of the problem.

Smaller number means a more difficult problem. The range of difficulty is 1-8 kyu.

Each file contains url to the problem, the difficulty, description of the problem and my solution.

My profile: https://www.codewars.com/users/olenele
Solutions on the site are visible only to the users who have completed the kata.
